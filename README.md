# CyclingAnalasisFunction
Python module for analysing raw data taken from strava using the Source plugin to dowland raw CSV files

This is made by a dyslexic physicist so don't expect anything close to best practice

Module is made for a linux file space and may not work for windows, i make no promises

1. Clone this repo
2. (Optional but advised) Run the following command to set up virtual env. `python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate`
3. Install the dependencies - `pip install -r requirements.txt`
